When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Whenever you don't have access to your computer or when you want other people cooperating to the file

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you might not want some changes to be public or to be automatically synced
